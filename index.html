    <h2>About Ars Mentis</h2>
    <p>
      At Ars Mentis, learning is approached as an art of dialogue—rigorous, joyful, and intellectually alive. Lessons are designed to stretch the mind with creativity and care, drawing on classical inquiry, cognitive research, and a deep respect for each student’s pace and personality.

      The tutor behind Ars Mentis is an enthusiastic young woman with several years of experience delivering high-end, individualized instruction. A native English speaker and fluent French bilingual, she brings warmth, clarity, and structure to every session—adapting not only to academic needs but to personal learning styles.

      Instruction is delivered virtually, with available lesson plans and tailored session summaries upon request.
